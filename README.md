# Portfolio with Next.js with Tailwind CSS and React Bricks UI


## ðŸš€ Quick start

I suggest that you use the CLI and choose this starter.  
In this way you will have the credentials already set up in a `.env.local` file:

```bash
npx create-reactbricks-app
# or
yarn create reactbricks-app
```

Otherwise you can directly clone this repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Thabhelo/thabhelo-portfolio/tree/main
```
